                                                  AMAZON PRODUCTS REVIEWS SENTIMENTAL ANALYSIS
In today's business world, customer feedback plays a crucial role in shaping product development, marketing strategies, and customer support. Understanding the sentiment of customers towards a product or service is essential for businesses to identify areas for improvement and to highlight strengths of the product. However, manually analyzing a large volume of customer reviews can be time-consuming and error-prone. To overcome this challenge, sentiment analysis using automated tools has become increasingly popular in recent years.

In this study, we aim to analyze the sentiments of customer reviews for a particular product on Amazon using a popular sentiment library - NLTK. The reviews are scraped from the Amazon website using the product link.


                                                  Sentiment Analysis Concept Approaches Using NLTK
The NLTK sentiment concept analysis technique is demonstrated in the following phases:
1. Import the Modules first:-
Through using import keywords, we load the modules for pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and seaborn throughout this stage. 
Equations involving linear algebra are handled by the NumPy module. 
Analysis of documents is done using the Panda module. 
For improved visualization, the Matplotlib package is utilized. 
For improved visibility, the Seaborn modules is also employed. 

2.DATASET:
For the dataset, we have used  dataset from ‘amazon_reviews.csv’ file extracted from Kaggle to obtain the optimum result.

3.TRAIN AND TEST THE MODEL ON GIVEN DATASET:
Here, we have used the Logistic Regression Model to predict sentiments on the given data and its performance is evaluated with the help of accuracy. In this model, we have calculated the accuracy of Text Processing with the help of TF-IDF vectorization methods:-
1. Count Vectorization method.
2. TF-IDF word vectorization method.
3. TF-IDF n-gram vectorization method.
4. TF-IDF char vectorization method.

4.ANALYSIS:
Final step is sentiment analysis of the amazon product reviews that is shown in the form of reviews and rating. The rating will imply the average users feelings. If the user gives very less rating, then it is obvious that the user is not satisfied with the products from the company. Or the user gives very huge rating, then it implies that the customer is exhilarated by the product. The code implementation of the above amazon product reviews dataset can be seen in the project.
                                                        
                                                     Conclusion
Sentiment analysis is the technique of employing computers to group several connected text examples into different groups. 
These methods use the advanced built-in machine learning algorithms of NLTK to order to understand the dynamics from linguistic data. For instance, NLTK sentiment classification can help us determine the amount of positive and negative participation on a certain problem.
